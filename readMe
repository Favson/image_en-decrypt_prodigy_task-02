🛡️ Image Encryption Tool using XOR and Tkinter GUI

This project is a simple yet powerful image encryption and decryption tool built with Python using the Tkinter GUI library. 
It allows users to select an image file (.jpg or .png), provide a numeric key, and encrypt/decrypt the image using XOR byte manipulation.

✨ Features
🔐 Encrypts any .jpg or .png file using a numeric key
🔓 Decrypts an encrypted image by reusing the same key
🖱️ Simple graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter
⚡ Fast, lightweight, and easy to use
🧠 How It Works

The image is opened in binary mode and read into a bytearray. Each byte is then XOR-ed with the numeric key provided by the user. 
Since XOR is a reversible operation, reapplying the same key decrypts the image.

Note: If you encrypt the image once with a key, you must use the same key to decrypt it successfully.
Tools Used
Python 🐍
Tkinter (for GUI)
File handling and byte-level XOR logic
🚀 How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   git clone https://github.com/Favson/image-encryption-tool.git
   cd image-encryption-tool
2. Run the script:
   python encryptor.py
3. In the GUI:
Click "Encrypt/Decrypt"
Choose your image file
Enter a numeric key
The image will be encrypted or decrypted (depending on its current state)
⚠️ Warning

- This modifies the original image file in place. Always keep a backup before encryption!
- Make sure to remember your encryption key. Without it, the image cannot be decrypted.
